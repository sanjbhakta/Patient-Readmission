# Patient-Readmission
Predicting likelihood of diabetic patients that may be readmitted

<h1> Patient Readmission Prediction </h1>

<p>
Predicting those patients that are likely to be readmitted may significantly reduce the cost of healthcare and improve patient outcome.  This notebook is focused on evaluating patients with the pre-existing condition of diabetes.  The objective is to quickly assimilate from the reference research paper, cleanse the data, prepare the features, and build rudimentary data science models.  The focus is on "speed" of assimilation, as many other references and notebooks have developed data science models and performed evaluations. A near-future revision of the notebook shall include a comparison with automl, as that's the final target.<br>

<p>
<h5 id="assumption">Data Requirements</h5>
    For conceptual demonstration, an open source dataset for patient admission shall suffice<br>
<h5 id="approach">Data Collection</h5>
Leverage diabetic dataset from UCI for concept illustration<br>
